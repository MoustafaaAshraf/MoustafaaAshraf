- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Moustafa Ashraf


- I have always been interested in questions about my inner and outer worlds, which were usually bigger than my current domain of knowlegde. 
That lead me into a lot of wondering in Psychology, Philosophy and Social Sciencies. 
- At some lucky point in my life, I heard about data science, the science of making sense of large chuncks and knowledge to make sense of the past, be real to the present and 
see future more clearly. And I got hooked :D


- Iâ€™m currently learning Recommendation Systems

- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects

- I would love to help with anything concerning coding and data, If you need my help just drop me a message on my LinkedIn
